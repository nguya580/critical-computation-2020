          Critical Computation Lecture + Lab (CC Lecture + CC Lab) are
          corequisites that work hand-in-hand to introduce computation and code
          as an expressive medium for artists, designers, and technologists. CC
          Lecture provides an introduction to computation through a series of
          critical inquiries and technical fundamentals, while CC Lab serves as
          a continuum of CC Lecture by applying theories to practice through a
          series of experimentations and play. Together, the three learning
          pillars for CC Lecture + CC Lab are code, critique, and design.
          <br />
          <br />
          CC Lecture provides a critical approach to thinking and working with
          technology by introducing programming concepts within a social and
          historical context. Through an intersectional feminist lens, the
          course unpacks design biases embedded in pervasive technology while
          pointing towards examples of expressive, critical, and
          community-centric ways of working with technology. On the technical
          end, the course introduces programming fundamentals through p5.js,
          followed by examples of additional JavaScript libraries and external
          APIs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lab expands the topics covered in CC Lecture through extended
          tutorials, pair-programming sessions, embodied group activities, and
          one-on-one mentoring. The lab structure allows students to process the
          course materials and Assignments assigned by CC Lecture, and further
          develop the assignments based on their own individual interests and
          background.

          Critical Computation is a community of learners interested in
          exploring the creation of art and design with technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every
          gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,
          language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture,
          subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and
          background. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect
          self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          We like these hashtags: <b>#noCodeSnobs</b> (because we value
          community over efficiency), <b>#newKidLove</b> (because we all started
          somewhere), <b>#unassumeCore</b> (because we don't assume knowledge),
          and <b>#BlackLivesMatter</b> (because of course).

          <li class="bullet">We listen to each other.</li>
          <li class="bullet">
            We recognize that people learn in different ways, therefore we don’t
            judge when someone asks a question.
          </li>
          <li class="bullet">
            We actively recognize and validate multiple types of backgrounds and

          <li class="bullet">We are mindful and kind in our interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A collaborative effort between students and the CC Lecture + Lab
          faculty is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While
          everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually,
          if a class member points out that something you have said or shared
          with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach
          the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from
          one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in
          discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are
          encouraged to speak with one of the CC faculty or the MFADT director
          John Sharp.

            Land Acknowledgement
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          We would like to acknowledge the Lenni-Lenape people who are the
          original inhabitants of Lenapehoking and the island of Mannahatta. The
          land The New School University is built upon, including all of New
          York City, present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the
          Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson
          Valley, comprise Lenape ancestral homeland. This land was not ceded
          nor sold, as folklore would have us believe, to the Dutch for beads
          and trinkets.
          <br />
          <br />
          This land was forcibly taken through occupation by European settlers,
          resulting in displacement, forced migration, and genocide. In the
          present day there are Lenape communities throughout North America,
          though much of the original Lenape territory remains under settler
          occupation and control.
          <br />
          <br />
          As settlers who have benefitted from the colonization of sovereign
          land we acknowledge our responsibility to examine and question systems
          of oppression that continue through to the present day and educate
          ourselves about the original stewards of this land.
          <br />
          <br />
          * We also want to acknowledge the Haudenosaunee ironworkers from the
          Six Nations of the Iroquois, mostly from the Mohawk tribe whose labor
          built the many iconic skyscrapers and steel bridges in New York City.
          As recently as 2012 about 200 of the 2,000 structural ironworkers in
          NYC are Mohawk. Every day we view the city skyline of Manhattan we are
          reminded of their contribution.
