        <h1>
          Objective
        </h1>
        <p>
          Draw an object described to you in plain language through code.
        </p>

        <h1>
          Description
        </h1>
        <p>
          We remember the past through word and image. Oftentimes when we
          describe our memories to our friends, our spoken words construct an
          image in their mind. This image is their interpretation of our
          memories and inevitably it’s going to look very different from the
          image in our mind. Because unlike a computer programming language, the
          human language is spectacularly ambiguous. It is always approximative
          and never fully accurate.
          <br /><br />
          This is an assignment completed in pairs of two. Your partner will be
          assigned to you. The assessment of the assignment is not dependent on
          the work your partner completes. Your work will be evaluated based on
          the code you produce and reflections you write.
          <br /><br />
          For example, to describe a smiley face:
        </p>

        <div class="two-grid-container">
          <div class="two-grid-item">
            <b>Human Language</b>
          </div>
          <div class="two-grid-item">
            <b>Computer Language</b>
          </div>
          <div class="two-grid-item">
            The person is looking straight ahead and carrying a smile.
          </div>
          <div class="two-grid-item">
            noFill();<br />
            strokeWeight(4);<br />
            stroke(0);<br />
            ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);<br />
            arc(200, 215, 33, 30, 0, PI);<br />
            fill(0);<br />
            ellipse(180, 190, 10, 10);<br />
            ellipse(220, 190, 10, 10);<br />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Assignment 1 explores this ambiguity in human language as well as the
          gap between human language and computer language. Completed in pairs
          of two, you will work with a partner and exchange detailed
          descriptions of a personal object you have lost in the past. Then
          based on the descriptions, you will re-create the objects for your
          partner in p5.js.
          <br /><br />
          The assessment of the assignment is not dependent on the work your
          partner completes. Your work will be evaluated based on the code you
          produce and reflections you write.

        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Choose an image (or photo) that has meaning to you. Keep the actual
            image you have chosen to yourself. You will reveal it to your
            partner later. (Be sure to select an image that you feel comfortable
            sharing. The image should have personal meaning, but if you wish to
            keep it private, it’s best to select another image.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Describe this image using plain language. It is up to you how much
            detail you impart, but be mindful of your own assumptions about what
            your partner might know about people or places depicted in the
            image.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to share your written description in CC Lab on 9/3,
            where you will be paired with a partner. Be ready to discuss the
            work you are doing, along with any questions you may have about the
            next part of the assignment.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Part 2: Due 9/8
        </h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Share your description (but not the actual image) with your assigned
            partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            After exchanging descriptions begin drawing that image on a piece of
            paper. Then transfer the drawing in pseudocode. Be sure to include
            the following technical components in your sketch:
            <ul>
              <li>2D primitives</li>
              <li>fill() and blendMode()</li>
              <li>Translate(), Rotate(), Push(), Pop()</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Be sure to include the following information at the top of your
            sketch.js:
            <ul>
              <li class="bullet">Your name</li>
              <li class="bullet">The course name (CC Lecture) and faculty</li>

              <li class="bullet">Your project reflections</li>
            </ul>

          <li>
            Reflect upon the following:
            <ul>
              <li class="bullet">
                The language your partner used to describe the image

              <li class="bullet">The depiction of the image using code</li>
