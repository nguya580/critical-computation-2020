        <h1>
          Objective
        </h1>

        <p>
          Design and code a bitmap game that tells an aspect of your own story.
        </p>

        <h1>
          Description
        </h1>

        <p>
          Every one of us has a story, a narrative that we either tell to
          ourselves or others, about who we are. This story can reveal a lot
          about our interests, values, and history.
          <br /><br />
          For Assignment #7, you will design an autobiographical bitmap game. We
          have learned how to incorporate elements of time using the
          conditionals; how to create repetitions and patterns using for loops, and we have
          learned how to store lists of values using arrays. In the upcoming
          weeks we will learn about classes and objects. Think about how you
          would incorporate all that you have learned and will learn to design a
          unique game idea.

          <br /><br />
          The specific details about yourself that you choose to include in your
          game are up to you. The tone of the game can be serious and reflective
          or lighthearted and whimsical. You can either follow game conventions
          by creating rewards and winning conditions, or follow examples of
          experimental or indie games that do not follow a prescriptive format
          (e.g.
          <a
            href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/30/walking-simulators/"
            >walking simulator games</a
          >). What is most important is that the game reflects who you are and
          is intentional in terms of how you present your story.
        </p>

        <h1>
          Design Requirements
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Main Character
        </h2>
        <p>
          Design a character who will serve as the protagonist of the game. This
          character will play a crucial role in your autobiographical game, so
          please take careful considerations when designing what the character
          is capable of and how their fears and desires manifest. 
          <br><br>
          You will use classes and objects to code your character.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Beginning / Middle / End Scenes
        </h2>

        <p>
          Incorporate three scenes in your game, each representing the
          beginning, the middle and the end. At the end of your game,
          incorporate a feature so that the player can hit a button to play
          again. <br><br>You will use the switch statement to create scene transitions.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Mouse / Keyboard Interaction
        </h2>

        <p>
          Incorporate mouse or keyboard interaction in your game. Please don’t
          use more than four keys. Make it easy for the player to figure out
          which keys to press.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Part 1 : Draft Proposal (DUE 10/15)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Bring a basic description of your game to Lab. Include details on who
          your main character is, and what is going to happen in the beginning,
          middle and the end.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Part 2 : Completed Proposal (DUE 10/20)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Update your draft proposal to create a thoughtful, scene-by-scene
          description of the character and the game. Include visual details and
          storyboards that show the layout of your scenes.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Part 3: White-boxing (DUE 10/27)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Building on what you have learned about classes and objects from the
          Frogger tutorial, you will pre-determine the placement of your
          character and interactive targets the character can collide into along
          the journey to create a “white-box” version of your bitmap game.
          <br /><br />
          This white-box version of your game allows you to map out basic
          interactions throughout all three scenes before working out the
          specific visual and interactive details. Use the switch statement to
          create your scene-to-scene transition.
          <br /><br />
          Creating a white-boxed version of the project keeps your code
          organized and makes it easier to debug before you add in all the
          details. You can integrate features in addition to the basic “Frogger”
          functions, such as a score keeper, a pop-up dialogue box, or a
          treasure chest.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Part 4: Bitmap Game (DUE 11/10)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Once the white-box version of your game functions, complete your game
          with visual details. You can either draw your bitmap graphics with for
          loops or create illustrations that you import using image(). Test play
          your game with a friend or a classmate without giving them any
          guidance on how to play the game. You will likely learn a lot about
          what’s missing in your design by watching someone else play.
